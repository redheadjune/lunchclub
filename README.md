Lunch Club
==========

As your organization continues to grow it becomes harder and harder to know everyone on each team at all, let alone on a personal level. Lunch Club is a way to get to know and keep in touch with your fellow teammates in a structured and rewarding manner.

How does it work?
-----------------

Every month all active members of Lunch Club will be assigned a clique of 1-4 other members. The goal is to go out with each member of your clique in turn over the course of the month (avg 1 lunch per week). Ideally by the end of each month all pairwise combinations of members in the clique will have gone to lunch together. As a reward for cliques that succeed in this goal the organization will sponsor a lunch (up to $20/member) for the entire clique to go out together.
